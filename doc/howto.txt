How To: Using the javalib interface to the Gothello daemon
Bart Massey 2001/11/26

The Java client "library" for the Gothello daemon is a
standard Java 1.3 class.  You will need the files
GthClient.class and Move.class, which you may either use
as-is or compile for yourself.

In brief, it is used by creating a new GthClient object,
which automatically connects to the specified server on the
specified host as the specified player.  (See the
documentation on running a Gothello game for details.)  The
client object then handles the details of making moves and
getting moves from the server, using the make_move() and
get_move() methods.  These accept and return Move objects.
Time control tracking is performed by the client object,
which caches a bunch of state information about the game
in progress in public fields.

There is javadoc documentation in the javadoc subdirectory
of this directory, which should make the details of using
GthClient and Move much clearer.  Also, the Grossthello Java
Gothello player is available as a good example of what a
Java client might look like.

Let me know if there are questions or bugs.
